                    Ceramic Pro is the first client of the company in Latvia, as
                    well as the first client abroad.

                    After changing the car wash system and approach to working
                    with the client, under the new Ceramic Pro brand, the task
                    was to bring more customers in the 16/17 tourist season than
                    in the 15/16 season.

                  <p className={s.description__text}>
                    The main focus of the photo session/photo presentation was
                    to be the Ceramic Pro logo and new corporate identity, as
                    well as the workflow and higher level of the average
                    customer. This project has become a pilot project for our
                    company in terms of introducing a unique Motivator design
                    with the logo of the client's company. The task was also to
                    orient the issue in Google search for a Russian-speaking
                    tourist/client.{" "}

                    The result was not long in coming, already in the next 16/17
                    season in Jurmala, 17% more customers turned to the car wash
                    than in the 15/16 season. According to our forecasts, they
                    should grow up to 25% over the next
